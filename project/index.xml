      <description>Non-ideal state equations are needed to compute a growing number of engineering-relevant problems. The additional computational overhead from the complex thermodynamics accounts for a significant portion of the total computation, especially the near-critical or transcritical thermodynamic regimes. A compromise between computational speed and the accuracy of the thermodynamic property evaluations results in a propagation of the error from the thermodynamics to the hydrodynamic computations. This work proposes a systematic error quantification and computational cost estimate of the various approaches for equation of state computation for use in compressible Navier-Stokes solvers in the supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>Real fluid effects on Shock Tube flow at supercritical conditions</title>

      <description>A study on shock tube simulations under supercritical thermodynamic conditions to investigate real fluid effects on the wave propagation. The numerical methods are an approximate riemann solver modified for real fluid thermodynamics. Three cases are studied supercriticial, nearcritical and subcritical conditions. Also an attempt has been made to study the transcritical case using the double flux method, but the spurious pressure oscillations failed the simulation.</description>
